                    My name is Dena'e Luna. I'm newly 30-years old. I'm a mother of two 
                    wild toddlers Liam and Xayla. I've been happily married to a man I 
                    met on Xbox live 10 years ago. I'm currently serving in the US Air Force
                    as a Public Health Flight Chief at Edwards Air Force Base in California. 
                    I intend to be high school teacher when I grow up.

                    As you may have guessed, I love playing video games. That's how my hubby
                    and I met. Back then I was a ranked player when it wasn't cool to be a female
                    gamer, but I tell you what--I still make a mean sandwich.

                    One of my other favorite things to do in my free time is write short stories. 
                    Currently working with the publishing company to get one of my horror stories 
                    published I'll post it here when I'm done.

                    My last favorite hobby is running. I used to hate it, but now I find such power 
                    and strength in pushing myself further than I thought I could. I intend to run a 
                    marathon next year.

                        I've done well for myself coaching others. Part of my job every day 
                        is one on one coaching with my team. I've been certified in resilience, 
                        team building, in project management.

                        I deployed in 2015 to Qatar for seven months. Our mission there was primarily 
                        support for the Qatari troops and to act as a hub for other deployment locations 
                        in that area. My job was disease prevention and control. While deployed I actually 
                        encountered a patient who had contracted Lyme disease and was suffering the severe
                        consequences after he landed in country. We were able to get him safely back home
                        after some antibiotics

                    What are my favorite experiences thus far would be my current job as flight chief of 
                    the public health flight. I'm in charge of managing these amazing airmen and keeping 
                    all of our lives together during this pandemic. They are my family away from family.
                    Everyday I got to work it is to serve them and to make sure that they make it home safe.
